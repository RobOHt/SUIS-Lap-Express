# SUIS-Lap-Express
An autonomous driving project for delivering objects across a SUIS compus lap.
### This project includes following versions: 
| Version | Description |
| --- | --- |
| SLE_trail | SLE_trail is a program that enables a car to drive autonomously in a Carla-Simulator world. It's written as a practice before implementing self-driving program on a physical chasis. |
| SLE_prototype | The prototype version of SLE enables the physical vehicle to be remotely (and manually) controlled, effectively achieving a RC Car functionality. |
| SLE_1.0 | Version 1.0 of SLE is the first version with a self-driving algorithm. The algorithm is logic-based and uses hough-line detection to precisely follow the edge of a lap track. |
| SLE_2.0 | Version 2.0 sees the self-driving logic overhauled to be much less computationally expensive, hense bringing the vehicle's top speed to up to 10 times faster. |
| SLE_3.0 | Version 3.0 is an upcoming version with a CNN-based self-driving algoritm. |
| SLE_4.0 | Version 4.0 is an upcoming version with a Convolutional LSTM based self-driving algoritm |
